## Building the project
hit `npm i` in all 3 folders (backend common frontend)

## Running the project
### Windows
Just run `./run.bat`

### Linux
Use your brain to run those 3 commands inside the `./run.bat` file.
If you're using linux you're used to these stuff, no?
I believe in you!

### Mac
What are you even doing with your life?
Same instructions as linux but with the exception I don't believe in you, sorry :c
